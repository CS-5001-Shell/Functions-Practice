"""
Write a Python program that implements a function 
lucky_sum(a: int, b:int , c:int) -> int 
that takes as input three integers and returns their sum. However, if one of the values is 13 then it does not count towards the sum and values to its right do not count. So for example, if b is 13, then both b and c do not count.

Implement a main method that tests this function by calling it at least five
times with different test cases. For full credit, make sure your test cases test
different possible conditions.

This exercise is taken from the coding bat website. Students may not
