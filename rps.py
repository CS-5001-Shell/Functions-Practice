"""
Write a Python program that uses functions to play the game rock, paper, scissors. Play will proceed as follows:

- A random number will be selected to represent the computer choice. A 1 will be "rock"; a 2 will be "paper"; and a 3 will be "scissors".
- The user will be prompted to enter a choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
- If the user choice is valid the computer choice and user choice will be compared and a winner will be declared.
  * paper beats rock 
  * rock beats scissors
  * scissors beats paper
- If the user choice is not valid then play will end.

Hints:
- Grading will primarily depend upon how you decompose your program into
functions. Consider the steps listed above as you think about which functions to
implement. Also, consider going back to the preliminary design we discussed in class.
- You must validate the user input to confirm that it is either rock, paper, or scissors.
